# Server Transfer bot

### simple file transfer between server and local computer using Telegram bot.

There is application like FileZilla that use ftp to do same thing. but telegram bot with some internets are faster like my own internet.

I plan to add file exploring, zip/unzip files and i don't know it's possible or not but i want add some function that you can run executables in server, to test program like telegram bots that mostly are single file.
